Example Description

This example describes how to use freertos tickless with uart interruptable interface

Procedure
(1) Freertos will enter/leave tickless automatically.
(2) User can type "Enter" in log uart to wake KM0 and KM4.
(3) KM4 excute app_loguart_resume() function.
(4) KM4 is keep awake 5s.
(5)	KM4 excute app_loguart_suspend() function then enter sleep mode.
(6) KM0 keep alive 13s then enter sleep mode.
(7) Repeat Steps (2)-(6) to realize chip enter/leave sleep mode

Notes:
(1) Freertos enter tickless if the wakelock bit map is 0.
	It means there is no function require system keep awake.
	By default there is PMU_OS keep system awake.
	So we need release this PMU_OS enable tickless mode.
(2) KM4 keep alive time is adjustable by parameter of pmu_set_sysactive_time(), unit is ms.
(3) To realize loguart wake up KM0, .km0_osc2m_close of struct ps_config in rtl8721dlp_sleepcfg.c should be set FALSE.
(4) As the power of KM4 is controlled by KM0, to realize loguart wake event wake up KM4, BIT_LP_WEVT_UART_STS of hs_wakeevent_config[] in rtl8721dlp_sleepcfg.c should be set.
